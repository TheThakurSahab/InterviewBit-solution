A robot is located at the top-left corner of an A x B grid

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked ‘Finish’ in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: A and B will be such that the resulting answer fits in a 32 bit signed integer.

Example :

Input : A = 2, B = 2
Output : 2

2 possible routes : (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) 
              OR  : (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)
 
                
public class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if (m == 1 || n == 1)
            return 1;
        m--;
        n--;
        if(m < n) {              // Swap, so that m is the bigger number
            m = m + n;
            n = m - n;
            m = m - n;
        }
        long res = 1;
        int j = 1;
        for(int i = m+1; i <= m+n; i++, j++){       // Instead of taking factorial, keep on multiply & divide
            res *= i;
            res /= j;
        }
            
        return (int)res;
    }
}
